Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate **Data Analyst** with expertise in multiple technologies and tools. I love working with data, extracting meaningful insights, and presenting them in a way that drives decision-making.

## üìä Skills & Tools

### üß∞ Data Analysis & Visualization Tools:
- **SQL**: Writing efficient queries and optimizing database performance.
- **Python**: Data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.
- **Excel**: Advanced functions, pivot tables, and data analysis.
- **Power BI**: Building interactive reports and dashboards.
- **Tableau**: Creating visually appealing, data-driven visualizations.

### üîß Big Data & Cloud Technologies:
- **Hadoop**: Distributed storage and processing of large datasets.
- **AWS**: Leveraging cloud solutions for data processing and storage.

## üìà Data Science & Analytics Projects

Here are a few examples of the projects I've worked on:

1. **COVID-19 DATA ANALYSIS USING PANDAS**  
The **COVID-19 Data Analysis** project involves exploring and analyzing publicly available COVID-19 datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about the pandemic. Using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, this project focuses on understanding the impact of the pandemic across different regions, tracking infection rates, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination progress.

**Technologies used:**
  
- **Python**: For data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization and creating plots.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration, analysis, and documentation.
### üìà Results:
- Visualized COVID-19 infection and death trends globally and across various regions.
- Analyzed the effectiveness of lockdown measures and vaccination progress.
- Identified countries with the highest and lowest infection rates and studied the correlation with various factors like population and healthcare systems.
  

2. **SPAM SMS/EMAIL DETECTION ANALYSIS**  
   This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect and classify SMS or email messages as **spam** or **ham** (non-spam). The project utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **machine learning algorithms** to analyze textual data, identify patterns, and classify messages effectively.

**Technologies used:**
  
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, machine learning model development, and evaluation.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building machine learning models and performing feature extraction.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical data operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing model performance and data insights.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and documentation.
### üìà Results:
- Achieved an **accuracy** of over 90% in detecting spam messages.
- The **Naive Bayes classifier** performed well due to its simplicity and efficiency in handling text data.
- The final model demonstrated robust performance across both SMS and email data.
